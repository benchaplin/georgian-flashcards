The file georgian.md holds my raw notes from class. I create flashcards in the format of the .txt files out of these notes (english;georgian). master.txt is a compilation of all the other .txt files, with an additional field for category (english;georgian;category).

Help me turn my notes into flashcards. At the end, make sure all .txt files are appended into master.txt (including their category) which I use for my flashcard app.

I put verb conjugations in 2x3 markdown tables. For verb flashcards, pick two forms at random (e.g. the "I" form and the "you (pl)" form).
